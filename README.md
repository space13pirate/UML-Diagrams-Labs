  <h1>UML Diagrams & Design Patterns Labs</h1>
</div>

This repository contains UML diagrams and design pattern implementations created as part of the **Software and Systems Engineering Course**.  
All diagrams are generated using **PlantUML**, following best practices in software design and modeling.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate proficiency in various **UML diagram types** (class, component, deployment, use case, state machine, sequence, and activity diagrams) and apply them to real-world software systems.

Additionally, it includes a fully integrated **lab project on design patterns**, showing how five classic patterns can be implemented and visualized in a cohesive Python-based system.

- :office: [Smart Home Patterns](smart_home_patterns/) – Python implementation of 5 design patterns (Singleton, Factory Method, Facade, Observer, State) with UML diagrams


## :triangular_ruler: Design Patterns Lab: Smart Home

The folder [`smart_home_patterns/`](smart_home_patterns/) contains a complete lab assignment demonstrating **5 classic design patterns** implemented in Python and visualized using PlantUML:

- `Singleton` – SmartHomeHub as a global controller  
- `Factory Method` – dynamic creation of smart devices  
- `Facade` – high-level interface for smart home control  
- `Observer` – sensor-event notification system  
- `State` – internal state switching for smart light


## :hammer_and_wrench: Tools & Setup

- **PlantUML** for UML diagram generation  
- **Markdown & Git** for documentation and version control  
- **VS Code** with PlantUML plugins
